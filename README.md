## My Website

This is a website created by glowstik, for glowstik. See what I did there?
If you want to use this website for yourself go ahead, I just ask you credit me and change a couple things up.

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Glowstik-YT/glows-website
```
and then in your terminal run
```
cd glows-website
```

annd boom! you should have all my code. Once you are done cheating off me just run
```
npm run dev
```
in order to run it :)
